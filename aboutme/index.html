    <h2>GODWIN C.K FREEMAN</h2>
    <h2>The Optimist</h2>

    <p>My full name is Godwin Courage Kekeli Freeman and my nickname is "The Optimist".
        I turned 28 six days ago and i live in Ashaiman, Accra - Ghana.</p>
    <p> I'm the last of six kids and the only one to have ventured into Higher education.
        I'm currently unemployed and actively looking for a job.</p>
    
    <p> Technology fascinates me! A couple of years ago, I used a CMS (Wordpress) to design a few websites; that was my introduction to the world of web. 
    <p>Today I'm super excited I'm here  pursuing a BSc. Applied Technology Degree which i know very well will help me understand the 'bits and bytes' of web development from scratch . Hopefully, I hope to gain much knowledge in Programming and Databases 
        by the end of my degree program so i can eventually delve into Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.

    <p> I enjoy reading adventure and self help books. I like cooking a variety of local Ghanaian dishes of which
        Jollof rice is my favourite. </p>
    <p> I'm very excited to be studying with you guys. It is nice to meet you all.
        Thank you for taking time to read my About Me page.</p>
